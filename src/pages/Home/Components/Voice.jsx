            <div>
                Cooper represents a shift in country music—a new generation that’s tech-savvy, entrepreneurial, and fiercely authentic. 

                He created Cooped Up Records to own his music and his future. No big label. No middlemen. Just pure independence. <br />

                He’s not afraid to break the rules. He’s not afraid to remix classics. He’s not afraid to laugh at himself. And he’s not afraid to speak truth when it counts.

                He’s a country star for the TikTok era—but his heart is timeless.
