                Cooper’s real breakthrough didn’t happen on radio—it happened on TikTok.

                In October 2019, he started posting. Covers, remixes, original songs, goofy skits. It wasn’t polished. It wasn’t filtered. It was just him. Funny. Real. Talented. <br />

                The internet lit up.

                A country remix of the Black Eyed Peas’ “Where Is The Love?” exploded with over 5 million views. More videos followed—clever spins on classics, hilarious fan interactions, and genre-mashing originals that showcased his creativity.

                He wasn’t just gaining followers. He was building family. <br />

                Today, Cooper boasts over 14 million followers across platforms and has racked up more than 225 million streams—a digital empire, built from the ground up, one video at a time.
