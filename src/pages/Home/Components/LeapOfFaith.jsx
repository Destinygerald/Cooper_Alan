            <div> Nashville or Bust: The Leap of Faith </div>

            <div>
                After graduating in 2018, Cooper packed his car and took the leap so many dream of—he moved to Nashville. No guarantees. Just talent and a burning drive. <br />

                Not long after landing, he crossed paths with legendary songwriter and producer Victoria Shaw. Known for working with Garth Brooks and Lady A, Shaw saw something in Cooper. His charisma. His work ethic. His sound.

                She signed him to a publishing deal within weeks—a rare feat in a city full of dreamers. Cooper was officially in the room.

                From there, he began co-writing with Nashville heavyweights like Rivers Rutherford, Seth Mosley, Matt Nolen, Kent Blazy, Desmond Child, and others. Each session sharpened his pen, each day built his catalog. <br />

                But while many artists would stop there, waiting for the industry to catch up—Cooper took control of the wheel.
