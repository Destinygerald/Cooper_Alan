                Born on February 17, 1996, in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Cooper Alan grew up with southern charm, hardworking values, and a deep love for music. As a kid, his world was filled with classic rock, country legends, and the sweet twang of acoustic guitars. <br />

                By eighth grade, he was already in a bandâ€”writing songs, playing shows, and lighting up local bars with energy far beyond his years. His school friends knew him as the guy who could turn any get-together into a concert. And from high school into college at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Cooper was the soundtrack to southern Friday nights.

                His band became a staple across the Carolinas, playing parties, college events, and packed bars. But beneath the fun was a vision: take this energy to the world stage.
