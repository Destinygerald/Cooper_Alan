                Cooper Alan is more than just music.

                He’s a fighter for causes that matter. After facing personal struggles with mental health, Cooper launched the Cooper Alan Foundation, focused on raising awareness and support for mental wellness.

                In its first major event in Charlotte, NC, the foundation raised over $400,000, donating to organizations like the HopeWay Foundation. For Cooper, it’s not about headlines—it’s about healing.
