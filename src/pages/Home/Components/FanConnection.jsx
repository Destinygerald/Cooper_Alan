                What sets Cooper apart? His closeness to fans.

                He replies to DMs. He shares behind-the-scenes moments. He makes music inspired by real fan comments. He turns weddings, breakups, and birthdays into lyrics. <br/>

                Fans don’t just follow Cooper—they ride with him. They wear his merch. They show up at meet-and-greets. They share his songs with family. He’s built a movement, not just a fanbase.
